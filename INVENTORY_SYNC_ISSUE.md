# INVENTORY SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUE & SOLUTION

## Current Problem

There are TWO separate inventory systems that don't synchronize:

1. **Staff Inventory** (Inventory table) - Used by regular staff
2. **Shop Admin Inventory** (ShopInventory table) - Used by shop admins

## Impact

- Data inconsistency between staff and admin views
- Incorrect stock levels in reports
- Potential overselling or stock shortages

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Unified Inventory Service (RECOMMENDED)

Migrate all inventory operations to use ShopInventory table with proper shop context.

### Option 2: Synchronization Service

Create a service that automatically syncs between both tables.

### Option 3: Deprecate Staff Inventory

Phase out the old Inventory table and migrate all operations to ShopInventory.

## Implementation Status

- ❌ Current: Dual inventory systems (NOT synchronized)
- ✅ Recommended: Unified ShopInventory system for all operations

## Next Steps

1. Update staff inventory operations to use ShopInventory
2. Add shopId context to all inventory operations
3. Migrate existing Inventory data to ShopInventory
4. Update API documentation to reflect unified system
