# Stock Receipt & Inventory Security Integration

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### **Security Model Overview**

This document outlines the enforced security workflow between stock receipts and inventory operations to prevent unauthorized stock manipulation by staff.

---

## **üîí Security Rules Enforced**

### **1. STOCK-IN Operations (Restricted)**

- **Rule**: Staff **CANNOT** perform stock-in operations without approved stock receipts
- **Implementation**: All stock-in functions now check for:
  - ‚úÖ Approved stock receipt exists (`status: 'APPROVED'`)
  - ‚úÖ Sufficient remaining approved quantity available
  - ‚úÖ Proper shop-specific access control

### **2. STOCK-OUT Operations (Allowed)**

- **Rule**: Staff **CAN** perform stock-out operations freely
- **Purpose**: For sales, returns, damages, or other legitimate removals
- **Requirements**: Only requires existing inventory quantity check

---

## **üìã Workflow Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Stock Receipt Creation (Staff)**

```javascript
POST /api/stock-receipts
{
  "productId": 15,                    // Required: Product ID (integer)
  "receivedQuantity": 100,            // Required: Quantity received (integer)
  "supplierName": "ABC Optical",      // Optional: Supplier name
  "deliveryNote": "INV-2024-001",     // Optional: Delivery note reference
  "batchNumber": "BATCH-001",         // Optional: Batch number
  "expiryDate": "2025-12-31"          // Optional: Expiry date (ISO format)
}
// Note: shopId is automatically taken from authenticated user (req.user.shopId)
// Status: PENDING (awaiting admin approval)
```

### **Phase 2: Admin Approval (Shop Admin Portal)**

```javascript
PUT /shop-admin/stock/receipts/:id/verify
{
  "decision": "APPROVED",              // Required: "APPROVED" or "REJECTED"
  "verifiedQuantity": 95,              // Required for APPROVED: Actual verified quantity
  "adminNotes": "5 items damaged in transit",  // Optional: Admin notes
  "discrepancyReason": "DAMAGED_ITEMS" // Optional: Reason for discrepancy
}
// Status: APPROVED ‚Üí Staff can now stock-in up to 95 units
```

### **Phase 3: Staff Stock-In (Inventory Controller)**

```javascript
POST /api/inventory/stock-by-barcode
{
  "barcode": "1234567890",            // Required: Product barcode
  "quantity": 50,                     // Required: Quantity to add
  "price": 150.50                     // Optional: Update selling price
}
// ‚úÖ Validates shop access via validateShopAccess()
// ‚úÖ Checks approved receipt with validateApprovedReceipt()
// ‚úÖ Verifies remaining quantity (95-50=45 left)
// ‚úÖ Creates audit trail in StockMovement table
// ‚úÖ Updates receipt status to COMPLETED when fully consumed
// ‚úÖ Returns comprehensive response with inventory status
```

## **üîß Technical Implementation Details**

### **Modified Functions with Security Checks:**

#### **1. `updateStockByBarcode` (Barcode Stock-In)**

- ‚úÖ Checks for approved stock receipt
- ‚úÖ Validates remaining approved quantity
- ‚úÖ Creates stock movement audit trail
- ‚úÖ Updates receipt status to COMPLETED when fully consumed

#### **2. `stockIn` (Traditional Stock-In)**

- ‚úÖ Same security checks as barcode version
- ‚úÖ Supports both productId and barcode input
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail implementation

#### **3. `stockOut` & `stockOutByBarcode` (Stock-Out Operations)**

- ‚úÖ No stock receipt approval required (by design)
- ‚úÖ Added stock movement audit trails
- ‚úÖ Proper inventory quantity validation

### **Enhanced Stock Receipt Controller:**

- ‚úÖ `createStockReceipt` - Enhanced with product validation
- ‚úÖ `getStockReceipts` - List with status filtering
- ‚úÖ `getStockReceiptById` - Individual receipt details

---

## **üìä Database Relationships & Audit Trail**

### **Stock Receipt Flow:**

```
StockReceipt (PENDING)
    ‚Üì [Shop Admin Approval]
StockReceipt (APPROVED)
    ‚Üì [Staff Stock-In Operations]
StockMovement (STOCK_IN) + ShopInventory Update
    ‚Üì [When Fully Consumed]
StockReceipt (COMPLETED)
```

### **Audit Trail Tables:**

1. **StockReceipt** - Receipt creation and approval tracking
2. **StockMovement** - All inventory changes with staff attribution
3. **ShopInventory** - Current stock levels per shop

## **‚úÖ Testing Workflow**

### **1. Create Stock Receipt (Staff)**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/stock-receipts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": 1, "receivedQuantity": 100, "supplierName": "ABC Optical"}'
```

### **2. Approve Receipt (Admin)**

```bash
curl -X PUT /shop-admin/stock/receipts/1/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decision": "APPROVED", "verifiedQuantity": 95, "adminNotes": "5 items damaged in transit"}'
```

### **3. Stock-In with Approval (Staff)**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/inventory/stock-by-barcode \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"barcode": "123", "quantity": 50}'
```

### **4. Stock-Out (Staff - No Approval Needed)**
