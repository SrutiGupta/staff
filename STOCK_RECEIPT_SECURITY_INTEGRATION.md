# Stock Receipt & Inventory Security Integration

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### **Security Model Overview**

This document outlines the enforced security workflow between stock receipts and inventory operations to prevent unauthorized stock manipulation by staff.

---

## **üîí Security Rules Enforced**

### **1. STOCK-IN Operations (Restricted)**

- **Rule**: Staff **CANNOT** perform stock-in operations without approved stock receipts
- **Implementation**: All stock-in functions now check for:
  - ‚úÖ Approved stock receipt exists (`status: 'APPROVED'`)
  - ‚úÖ Sufficient remaining approved quantity available
  - ‚úÖ Proper shop-specific access control

### **2. STOCK-OUT Operations (Allowed)**

- **Rule**: Staff **CAN** perform stock-out operations freely
- **Purpose**: For sales, returns, damages, or other legitimate removals
- **Requirements**: Only requires existing inventory quantity check

---

## **üìã Workflow Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Stock Receipt Creation (Staff)**

```javascript
POST /api/stock-receipts
{
  "productId": 15,
  "receivedQuantity": 100,
  "supplierName": "ABC Optical",
  "deliveryNote": "INV-2024-001",
  "batchNumber": "BATCH-001"
}
// Status: PENDING (awaiting admin approval)
```

### **Phase 2: Admin Approval (Shop Admin Portal)**

```javascript
PUT /shop-admin/stock/receipts/:id/approve
{
  "decision": "APPROVED",
  "verifiedQuantity": 95, // Admin verified actual quantity
  "adminNotes": "5 items damaged in transit",
  "discrepancyReason": "DAMAGED_ITEMS"
}
// Status: APPROVED ‚Üí Staff can now stock-in up to 95 units
```

### **Phase 3: Staff Stock-In (Inventory Controller)**

```javascript
POST /api/inventory/stock-by-barcode
{
  "barcode": "1234567890",
  "quantity": 50,
  "shopId": 1
}
// ‚úÖ Checks approved receipt with remaining quantity (95-50=45 left)
// Creates audit trail in StockMovement
// If fully consumed (95 units), marks receipt as COMPLETED
```

## **üîß Technical Implementation Details**

### **Modified Functions with Security Checks:**

#### **1. `updateStockByBarcode` (Barcode Stock-In)**

- ‚úÖ Checks for approved stock receipt
- ‚úÖ Validates remaining approved quantity
- ‚úÖ Creates stock movement audit trail
- ‚úÖ Updates receipt status to COMPLETED when fully consumed

#### **2. `stockIn` (Traditional Stock-In)**

- ‚úÖ Same security checks as barcode version
- ‚úÖ Supports both productId and barcode input
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail implementation

#### **3. `stockOut` & `stockOutByBarcode` (Stock-Out Operations)**

- ‚úÖ No stock receipt approval required (by design)
- ‚úÖ Added stock movement audit trails
- ‚úÖ Proper inventory quantity validation

### **Enhanced Stock Receipt Controller:**

- ‚úÖ `createStockReceipt` - Enhanced with product validation
- ‚úÖ `getStockReceipts` - List with status filtering

## **üö® Error Scenarios Handled**

### **1. Unauthorized Stock-In Attempts:**

```json

  "error": "No approved stock receipt found for product [Name]. Staff cannot perform stock operations without shop admin approval.",
  "suggestion": "Create a stock receipt and wait for shop admin approval before performing stock operations."
}
```

### **2. Insufficient Approved Quantity:**

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient approved stock. Remaining approved quantity: 25, Requested: 50",
  "approvedReceipt": {
    "id": 123,
    "verifiedQuantity": 100,
    "consumedQuantity": 75,
    "remainingQuantity": 25
  }
}
```

### **3. Stock-Out Quantity Exceeds Inventory:**

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient stock. Available: 10, Requested: 15",
  "availableStock": 10
}
```

## **‚úÖ Testing Workflow**

### **1. Create Stock Receipt (Staff)**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/stock-receipts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -d '{"productId": 1, "receivedQuantity": 100}'
```

### **2. Approve Receipt (Admin)**

```bash
curl -X PUT /shop-admin/stock/receipts/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -d '{"decision": "APPROVED", "verifiedQuantity": 95}'
```

### **3. Stock-In with Approval (Staff)**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/inventory/stock-by-barcode \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -d '{"barcode": "123", "quantity": 50}'
```

### **4. Stock-Out (Staff - No Approval Needed)**

```bash
curl -X POST /api/inventory/stock-out-by-barcode \
